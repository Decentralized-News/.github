# decentNews: A Decentralized News Platform 📰🚨💡

## Introduction 🌐

decentNews is a cutting-edge decentralized news platform created at **ETHMunich Hackathon** 🏆. It empowers anyone to publish articles 📝, which will then be reviewed by peers 🔍. Upon receiving enough validation, the articles will be published on the website 🌐. Both authors and reviewers can earn rewards 💰 for accurate content and reviews, or face penalties for malicious actions ❌. This process establishes a truly independent news platform, allowing for transparent, community-driven journalism that operates free from centralized control or bias 🗽.

## How It Works ⚙️

### 1. **Publishing an Article** 📝
   - **Staking Ether**: To participate, users must stake Ether as a commitment against malicious activities 💸. (Deactivated in the MVP, however included in the Smart Contract 📑)
   - **Submitting Articles**: Anyone can write and submit an article for review ✍️.

### 2. **Peer Review Process** 🔎
   - **Random Assignment**: Articles are assigned to random reviewers through a true random process using Chainlink 🔗.
   - **Review and Validation**: Peer reviewers evaluate the article for accuracy and quality ✅.
   - **Threshold Validation**: If the article receives enough validations, it gets published 🎉.

### 3. **Reward and Punishment Mechanism** ⚖️
   - **Rewards**: Authors and reviewers receive rewards for accurate articles or reviews 🏅.
   - **Punishments**: Malicious actions lead to penalties, including the loss of staked Ether ❌.

### 4. **Decentralized Storage** 💾
   - **Hash Storage**: Article hashes are stored on a smart contract, guaranteeing integrity 🔒.
   - **Database Storage**: The actual article content is stored in a separate database, maintaining decentralization 🏢.

## Technologies Used 💻

- **Solidity**: For creating smart contracts and managing staking 🧠.
- **Chainlink**: For true randomness in the review assignment process 🔗.
- **React + Vite**: For a user intuitive interface 🖥️.
- **Node.js + MongoDB**: For storage of article content 🗃️.
